Title | Summary
|-|-|
[Population Based Training of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09846.pdf) | Hyperparameter optimization/meta-learning similar to evolutionary strategies by discarding the least performant and copy-perturbing the most performant at each step, with applications in DL, RL, and even GANs.
[RenderNet: A deep convolutional network for differentiable rendering from 3D shapes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06575.pdf) | Neural network for different types of 3D rendering & shading, capable of single-image reconstruction (i.e. few-shot learning). Is it possible to perform pruning to create NN-based performant renderers?
[HoloGAN: Unsupervised learning of 3D representations from natural images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01326.pdf) | Training 3D representations via backprop on 2D renders. Is it possible to do few-shot learning?
[Numeraire: A Cryptographic Token for Coordinating Machine Intelligence and Preventing Overfitting](https://numer.ai/whitepaper.pdf) | Betting system for models which incentivizes betters to reveal expected model performance.
[A New Interpretation of Information Rate](http://www.herrold.com/brokerage/kelly.pdf) | The famous Kelly criterion for risk management in maximizing log returns in the long run.
[An Impossibility Theorem for Clustering](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/nips15.pdf) | Clustering algorithms cannot simultaneously satisfy three theoretical axioms of behavior. Consider which one we want to break. [See here for another summary](http://alexhwilliams.info/itsneuronalblog/2015/10/01/clustering2/).
[Invariant Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02893.pdf) | A way to enable better generalization to out-of-distribution data when training on a given distribution. Fundamental and theoretical.
[Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf) | Task and model-agnostic method to optimize hyperparameters of models via a trainer model which performs backprop on average performance of child model over several unseen tasks.
[Learning Algorithms for Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00088.pdf) | Meta-learning the data selection for active learning based on only seeing the unlabeled data, useful for situations with high labeling cost.
[Snuba: Automating Weak Supervision to Label Training Data](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p223-varma.pdf) | Generate noisy labels for selected unlabeled data for further training by training on a smaller set of ground truth labels, outperforming heuristics of similar purpose in training the final model.
