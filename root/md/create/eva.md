Title | Summary
|-|-|
[Snuba: Automating Weak Supervision to Label Training Data](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p223-varma.pdf) | Generate noisy labels for selected unlabeled data for further training by training on a smaller set of ground truth labels, outperforming heuristics of similar purpose in training the final model.
[Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf) | Task and model-agnostic method to optimize hyperparameters of models via a trainer model which performs backprop on average performance of child model over several unseen tasks.
[Learning Algorithms for Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00088.pdf) | Meta-learning datapoint selection for active learning based on only unlabeled data, useful for situations with high labeling cost.
